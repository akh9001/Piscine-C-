The authors present the concept and implementation of the keyword
occurrence analysis that is based on the separate counting of (key)words in
the four main parts of scientific and other types of ARTICLEs: the title—followed
by a list of authors, abstract, list of keywords, and the main text. Also, the
analysis is meant to be applied to more than one ARTICLE at once. As such, it
can serve the researchers, writers, editors, and others for the reviewing and
statistical exploration of the ARTICLEs. For discrimination of the ARTICLE parts, the
already existing, implicit tagging must be minimally assisted by the user. That


is to be done on collection and conversion of the texts in one or more txt-
format input files. The proposed analysis of keywords occurrences is
implemented in a web-based PHP – MySQL application. It is already used for
the practical testing and provides a basis for the future improvements.
